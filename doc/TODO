  EC100 terminal blocks 
    --> characteristic impedance of the Cat5e armored ethernet cable is 100 ohm
        not 120 [wikipedia]; should different resistor size be used?

    From https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/RS-485 

    "A final note on transmission lines is that the termination resistor should
    match the characteristic impedance of the cable. If CAT-5 (100 O cable) 
    cable is used, the termination resistors should be 100 ohm, not the 120 ohm
    suggested in the standard and the above examples. However, an incorrect 
    value termination resistor will usually improve the signal quality compared
    to an unterminated network. A 120 O termination resistor can cause enough 
    loss with very long cables to stop the network from functioning. In this 
    case a 500 ohm or even a 1 kohm termination resistor may improve the signal
    quality with out causing too much signal loss. The value will have to be 
    determined empirically for the individual network." 

    --> alternately, Schottkey diodes could be used to clamp reflections in
    place of termination resistors

  same as signature algorithm described in EC150 manual (pg 19)
