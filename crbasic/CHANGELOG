Next Version
============

- Data type of `FIS_pmt_counts` in `ts_fast` table changes from FP2 (2 byte) to
  IEEE4 (4 byte).
- Redundant columns `LoggerSN` and `OSVersion` removed from `info` table; TOA5
  header contains that info.
- Adjust time-series (15-sec) values from WXT510 (ts_wxt/wxt_WD) for azimuth
  prior to storage; began adjusting half-hour values in v1.1. For PROPHET 2014,
  makes no difference since device was aligned to True North.


Version 1.1.2
=============

Hot fixes
---------

- Only increment calibration event counter once per event. 
- Retain calibration event count across power cycles.

Enhancements
------------

- Send email alert after program compilation with useful info: compile results,
  card status, program error count and watchdog error count


Version 1.1.1
=============

Hot fixes
---------

- Remove duplicate variable declaration; not causing any apparent issues but
  still not correct.
- Add a Public version of the FIS calibration schedule offset so users can
  easily determine the next cal time by looking at the cal interval and offset
  in the Public table.


Version 1.1
===========

Issues resolved
---------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation was corrected.
- Reduced number of significant figures retained in mean barometric pressure
  from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_press_Avg) from ~5 decimal places to 1
  decimal place since device only reports 2 decimal places.
- Modify storage type from unsigned integer to 2-byte floating point for all
  sonic anemometers and the weather transmitter in `info` table to permit 
  proper storage of the value-not-set sentinal (-1).
- Add units for half-hour WD values from weather transmitter.
- Reduce storage precision of mean altitude since GPS only provides 1 decimal
  place in its measurements
- Store mean and std. dev of wind directions as null values (NAN) if wind speed
  values are null. Logger returns 0/0 which, if corrected for azimuth, looks
  like real values. (sonics only)
- Ensure WD values from sonics, weather transmitter are always whole numbers.
- Replace instances of -99999 with null value (NAN) in the case of `sonic1_Ux`.


Enhancements
------------

- Adjust the half-hour WD values from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_WD_Med)
  to account for the device's orientation.
- Change field name to clarify the serial number recorded is for the datalogger
  (info/SerialNumber -> LoggerSN).
- Reynolds number values are rounded to the tens digit to emphasize uncertainty
  around values and its empirical basis.
- Change all tables to ring-fill mode to ensure, at a minimum, half-hour values
  will be generated and retained (via scheduled collection).
- Add mean dry molar mixing ratio of CO2 to half-hour data table. Calculated
  from half-hour mean values, not as an average of real-time mixing ratios.
  This is the proper method since system lacks a high-frequency temp sensor.
- Add program version reference string--the results of `git describe`--to the
  `info` data table. Makes it possible to easily locate associated commit.
- Add data table `just_cals` with only FIS data, stored in low-resolution data
  types, so FIS sensitivity can be evaluated as soon as calibration event ends.
  Previous only option was to collect `ts_fast` data table, which isn't very 
  practical since fill rate exceeds transfer rate even over ethernet.
- Store `FIS_cal_event` as 2-byte unsigned integer since always >=0 and max
  value (65535) represents 60 years @ 3 events/day. Saves 2 bytes in `ts_fast`.


Version 1.0.5
=============

- Resets SDM clock speed to default (3000->30).
- Adds hackish check for Ux = -99999 and sets disable flag if true.


Version 1.0.4
=============

- Further decreases SDM clock speed 300->3000.


Version 1.0.3
=============

- Further decreases SDM clock speed 150->300.


Version 1.0.2
=============

- Unhide data table `work` to aid diagnosing sonic1 behavior.
- Omit non-sonic variables from `ts_fast` data table and limit to ~3 hours of
  collection time to permit collecting table for diagnosing sonic1 issue.


Version 1.0.1
=============

- Decreases SDM clock speed from default value of 30 to 150 to (hopefully)
  resolve the issue causing Ux = -99999 from the sonic/IRGA unit.
- Unhides working table for diagnostic assessment.
- Removes non-sonic data from high-frequency time series table and sets an
  explicit size of 100,000 records (~3 hrs) to enable retrieval of time series
  data for diagnosing sonic1 issue.


Version 1.0
===========

First version deployed at UMBS PROPHET site. Settings (azimuths, heights,
flush tube length) NOT set. Run overnight for some take-home data, which was
deleted from DAQ monitoring laptop prior to departure. Measurements were set
in the program settings the morning of 2014-05-23 then program was restarted
and began officially operating. 

Known issues
------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation is inverted: divide 1 by value
  recorded in table (stats/flush_delay_Avg) to obtain correct delay estimate.
  Disregard standard deviation values (stats/flush_delay_Std). 
- Null values (NAN) were not explicitly excluded from WD/WS calculations so
  some half-hour values in `stats` table are NAN (all of sonic1). 
- The first value (Ux) reported by sonic/IRGA (EC150/CSAT3A/EC100) is -99999
  a minute fraction (0.07%) of the time. This is still enough, however, to 
  cause calculated mean wind speed to be null values (NAN), mean wind direction
  to be zero (when adjusted for azimuth, 353), and standard deviation of wind 
  direction to be 0. 
    This issue is particularly troublesome because the diagnostic flag is NOT
  set high when Ux = -99999 and, there is no indication in the user manual this
  behavior should ever occur.
