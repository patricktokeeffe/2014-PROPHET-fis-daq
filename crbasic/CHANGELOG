Version 1.1
===========

Issues resolved:
----------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation was corrected. (12945fe6)
- Reduced number of significant figures retained in mean barometric pressure
  from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_press_Avg) from ~5 decimal places to 1
  decimal place since device only reports 2 decimal places. (062a20bb)
- Modify storage type from unsigned integer to 2-byte floating point for all
  sonic anemometers and the weather transmitter in `info` table to permit 
  proper storage of the value-not-set sentinal (-1). (2749ac0e)
- Add units for half-hour WD values from weather transmitter (be2652d6)

Enhancements:
-------------

- Adjust the half-hour WD values from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_WD_Med)
  to account for the device's orientation. (757d482a)
- Change field name to clarify the serial number recorded is for the datalogger
  (info/SerialNumber -> LoggerSN). (b978b3b3)
- Save mean Reynolds number calculated each half-hour as integer (e43a206f)


Version 1.0.5
=============

- Resets SDM clock speed to default (3000->30).
- Adds hackish check for Ux = -99999 and sets disable flag if true.


Version 1.0.4
=============

- Further decreases SDM clock speed 300->3000.


Version 1.0.3
=============

- Further decreases SDM clock speed 150->300.


Version 1.0.2
=============

- Unhide data table `work` to aid diagnosing sonic1 behavior.
- Omit non-sonic variables from `ts_fast` data table and limit to ~3 hours of
  collection time to permit collecting table for diagnosing sonic1 issue.


Version 1.0.1
=============

- Decreases SDM clock speed from default value of 30 to 150 to (hopefully)
  resolve the issue causing Ux = -99999 from the sonic/IRGA unit.
- Unhides working table for diagnostic assessment.
- Removes non-sonic data from high-frequency time series table and sets an
  explicit size of 100,000 records (~3 hrs) to enable retrieval of time series
  data for diagnosing sonic1 issue.


Version 1.0
===========

First version deployed at UMBS PROPHET site. Settings (azimuths, heights,
flush tube length) NOT set. Run overnight for some take-home data, which was
deleted from DAQ monitoring laptop prior to departure. Measurements were set
in the program settings the morning of 2014-05-23 then program was restarted
and began officially operating. 

Known issues
------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation is inverted: divide 1 by value
  recorded in table (stats/flush_delay_Avg) to obtain correct delay estimate.
  Disregard standard deviation values (stats/flush_delay_Std). 
- Null values (NAN) were not explicitly excluded from WD/WS calculations so
  some half-hour values in `stats` table are NAN (all of sonic1). 
- The first value (Ux) reported by sonic/IRGA (EC150/CSAT3A/EC100) is -99999
  a minute fraction (0.07%) of the time. This is still enough, however, to 
  cause calculated mean wind speed to be null values (NAN), mean wind direction
  to be zero (when adjusted for azimuth, 353), and standard deviation of wind 
  direction to be 0. 
    This issue is particularly troublesome because the diagnostic flag is NOT
  set high when Ux = -99999 and, there is no indication in the user manual this
  behavior should ever occur.
