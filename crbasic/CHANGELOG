Version 1.0.1 [
==========================================

Issues resolved:
----------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation was corrected. (12945fe6)
- Reduced number of significant figures retained in mean barometric pressure
  from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_press_Avg) from ~5 decimal places to 1
  decimal place since device only reports 2 decimal places. (062a20bb)
- Explicitly exclude null values (NAN) from half-hour WD/WS values calculated
  for all three sonic anemometers. (b91aaf4e)
- Modify storage type from unsigned integer to 2-byte floating point for all
  sonic anemometers and the weather transmitter in `info` table to permit 
  proper storage of the value-not-set sentinal (-1). (2749ac0e)

Enhancements:
-------------

- Adjust the half-hour WD values from weather transmitter (stats/wxt_WD_Med)
  to account for the device's orientation. (757d482a)
- Change field name to clarify the serial number recorded is for the datalogger
  (info/SerialNumber -> LoggerSN). (b978b3b3)
- Save mean Reynolds number calculated each half-hour as integer (e43a206f)



Version 1.0 [build 2014-05-22T20:55:33-05]
==========================================

First version deployed at UMBS PROPHET site. Settings (azimuths, heights,
flush tube length) NOT set. Run overnight for some take-home data, which was
deleted from DAQ monitoring laptop prior to departure. Measurements were set
in the program settings the morning of 2014-05-23 then program was restarted
and began officially operating. 

Known issues:
-------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation is inverted: divide 1 by value
  recorded in table (stats/flush_delay_Avg) to obtain correct delay estimate.
  Disregard standard deviation values (stats/flush_delay_Std). 
- Null values (NAN) were not explicitly excluded from WD/WS calculations so
  some half-hour values in `stats` table are NAN (all of sonic1).
