Version 1.0.1
=============

- Increases SDM clock speed from default value of 30 to 150 to (hopefully)
  resolve the issue causing Ux = -99999 from the sonic/IRGA unit.


Version 1.0
===========

First version deployed at UMBS PROPHET site. Settings (azimuths, heights,
flush tube length) NOT set. Run overnight for some take-home data, which was
deleted from DAQ monitoring laptop prior to departure. Measurements were set
in the program settings the morning of 2014-05-23 then program was restarted
and began officially operating. 

Known issues
------------

- Flush tube delay time estimate calculation is inverted: divide 1 by value
  recorded in table (stats/flush_delay_Avg) to obtain correct delay estimate.
  Disregard standard deviation values (stats/flush_delay_Std). 
- Null values (NAN) were not explicitly excluded from WD/WS calculations so
  some half-hour values in `stats` table are NAN (all of sonic1). 
- The first value (Ux) reported by sonic/IRGA (EC150/CSAT3A/EC100) is -99999
  a significant fraction of the time. This causes calculated mean wind speed
  to be null values (NAN), mean wind direction to be zero (when adjusted for
  azimuth, 353), and standard deviation of wind direction to be 0. 
    This issue is particularly troublesome because the diagnostic flag is NOT
  set high when Ux = -99999 and, there is
