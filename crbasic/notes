EC100 serial output is:
- most probably fixed-length values
- values are comma delimited (no spaces)
- records are delimited by CR+LF
- a 4-byte hexadecimal checksum is the final value




Data record (in order received):
    Ux, m/s
    Uy, m/s
    Uz, m/s
    sonic temperature, degC
    sonic diagnostic bitmap
    CO2 density, mg/m^3
    H2O density, g/m^3
    IRGA diagnostic bitmap
    air temp, degC
    air pressure, kPa
    CO2 signal strength, unity
    H2O signal strength, unity
    pressure differential, kPa   <-- disregard for EC150; no value transmitted?
    counter, arbitrary
    checksum, arbitrary in hexadecimal
