Program
-------
- separate FIS_flow_std half-hour values into 'cal event' and 'non-cal event'
  then subtract the mean during non-events from mean during cal events to
  remove the MFC response to zero flow ----> this is important because the
  isoprene conc is determined by ratio of flow_std to flow_samp (total-O2)
- if PMT data stops, attempt to restart and if that fails, send an email alert
- save watchdog and program error count to file so previous values can also be
  noted in emails (allows users to easily see if/which counter increased); will
  require checking for counter=0 to reset saved counter;

Documentation
-------------
- clarify serial data handling of TSI mis-aligned byte problem solutions?
- include wiring diagram(s) as appendix?
- create 'specifications' section 
  * power consumption of devices
  * list of fuses (fis, ozonizer, switched outlet, ??)
